# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects! This repository showcases a variety of EDA techniques applied to different datasets, where I analyze, visualize, and draw insights from raw data. Each project in this repository explores different data cleaning, visualization, and analysis methods to gain a deeper understanding of the data.

## Introduction

EDA is an essential part of the data science workflow, helping us understand the dataset, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and form hypotheses for further modeling. This repository contains a collection of EDA notebooks and scripts applied to various datasets, with a primary focus on:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization (using libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- Summary statistics and correlation analysis
- Skewness, kurtosis, and distribution analysis
- Feature engineering and selection

## Projects

### 1. **[Anime Dataset EDA](./anime-eda.ipynb)**

- **Dataset**: Anime dataset with information on anime titles, ratings, genres, and user interactions.
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Distribution of anime ratings and genres
  - Correlation analysis between user engagement and ratings
  - Popularity trends over time
  - Genre-based analysis
  - Skewness and kurtosis of numerical columns


> **Note**: Each notebook includes detailed explanations of steps performed during the EDA process, visualizations, and findings.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies and libraries are used in these projects:

- **Python**: The primary language used for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For basic plotting and visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Scipy**: For advanced statistical analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning (if used in the analysis).
  
## Installation

To run the notebooks in this repository, youâ€™ll need to have Python installed, as well as the necessary libraries. You can install all required libraries using `pip` or `conda`.

### Using `pip`:
